# bitcoin-transact

This is a simple web app and experiment that tries to demonstrate how to send bitcoins from one address to another using nodejs and bitcore.
It was scaffolded with the [ng-fullstack](https://github.com/ericmdantas/generator-ng-fullstack) Yeoman generator.
I am making use of the [bicore](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-lib) and [bitcore-explorers](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-explorers) libraries
and the [blockchain.info API](http://blockchain.info/api) to fetch transaction information.


clone the repository and cd into the directory

Install the npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Install the bower dependencies:
```
bower install
```
To run the project on http://localhost:3333/:
```
npm start
```
You can also run in dev mode:
```
npm run dev
```
